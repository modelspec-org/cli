# Chinook sample database: storage-neutral data model (ModelSpec 1.0-draft).
#
# Module short name: chinook (references use modelspec:///chinook.<Entity>).
# Source of the structure: the pinned upstream SQLite fixture
# (data-source/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite). Entity and property names are the
# upstream table and column names, so each property matches one published
# column one to one. scripts/test-model.mjs fails when this file and the
# published data disagree.
#
# Reading notes:
# - A property with `entity = "X"` is a reference to an X record. It holds
#   X's key value (for example Album.ArtistId holds an Artist.ArtistId).
# - NVARCHAR(n) columns are `string` with `max_len = n`.
# - NUMERIC(10,2) columns are `decimal`; ModelSpec has no precision or scale
#   attribute, so "10 digits, 2 after the point" is recorded here only.
# - DATETIME columns are `datetime`. Every Chinook value has a midnight time
#   part ("2021-01-01 00:00:00"); the model keeps the stored type.
# - Meaning (what a column is for, synonyms, units, labels in other languages)
#   lives in chinook.meaning.yaml, not here.
